# CARLANE Dataset Tools

Official implementation of the CARLANE Dataset Tools used in the paper [CARLANE: A Lane Detection Benchmark for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation from Simulation to multiple Real-World Domains](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/19a260641ebaf68d412f427e591bb74a-Abstract-Datasets_and_Benchmarks.html).

## Tools & Utilities

- [CARLA Lane Generator](https://github.com/juliangebele/CARLANE/tree/master/CARLANE%20Dataset%20Tools/CARLA%20Lane%20Generator): This tool is used for generating annotated images in CARLA with 2 or 4 lanes, collected by a self-roaming agent.

- [CARLANE Labeler](https://github.com/juliangebele/CARLANE/tree/master/CARLANE%20Dataset%20Tools/CARLANE%20Labeler): This tool is used to manually annotate ground truth road lanes on images.

- [CARLANE Utilities](https://github.com/juliangebele/CARLANE/tree/master/CARLANE%20Dataset%20Tools/CARLANE%20Utilities): Several scripts, which are used to support the creation of the sim-to-real datasets.
